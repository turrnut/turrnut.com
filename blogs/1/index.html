    <h1>My opinion on Donald Trump, the president-elect</h1>
    <p><i>By Turrnut on November 30, 2024</i></p>
    <br/>

    <img class="align_right" src="img/1-1.png" alt="Donald J. Trump, the president-elect.">
    <p>
        Let's discuss Donald Trump—whether you love him or hate him, he have won the 2024
        presidential election, and it is a fact that he will become the next president of
        the United States.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Brief Recap</h2>
    <p>
        Before we analyze Trump, let's look at the facts first. Before he became president,
        he was a businessman. His holding company, <b>The Trump Organization</b>, which
        owned a lot of golf courses, operated and invested in fields such as real estate,
        hotels, resorts, etc.
    </p>


    <p>
        It is during this time that he developed an amibition to run for U.S. president,
        and to pursue fame. According to <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/politics/donald-trump-president-quote-maggie-haberman-book/index.html">
        CNN</a>, Trump said that a primary motivation to run for president is to be
        famous. Now, that is very honest of him, but at that time no one knows if he
        will be a good president or not yet.        
    </p>

    <h2>The 2016 Election</h2>
    <p>
        Trump ran in the 2016 presidential election as the Republic nominee
        against the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And since the start of his campaign,
        he made clear to Americans that he is a distinct candidate from his opponents. He promised
        to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, he launched an unfound accusation against Obama's
        birth certificate, and he invented the famous slogan "Make America Great Again", or MAGA for short.
    </p>

    <img class="align_left" src="img/1-2.avif" alt="Donald Trump, in a MAGA hat">

    <p>
        Now, Trump is unique because not only he represented the conservatism in America but also
        unlike Bush or Obama, his predecessors, Trump did not have any prior political experience
        before becoming president. The only experience he had was in business. As a result, he ran
        America the same way he would run a business.
    </p>

    <p>
        Running a business often requires you to prioritize profit over other things, and Trump's
        policies have reflected that priority. Trump prioritizes America first, while that might
        be considered good for some, it often come at the expense of other things.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, one of his major policy was to deport "illegal immigrants", and specifically
        Mexican immigrants because he believed that
        <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/donald-trump-announces-presidential-bid-trashing-mexico-mexicans-n376521">

            they're rapists and they're bringing drugs and crime.</a>
        Without examining it closely, you will realize that this statement is racist, xenophobic,
        with the intention of creating a public sentiment against Mexicans and Latino immigrants
        in the United States. Now, one might argue that this puts America first, but his policy
        did in someway, alter the values of America. For starters, most of the American population
        are immigrants, and if you are an American, you come from somewhere else(unless you're a
        Native American). But, when Trump assumed office created this rhetoric against immigrants,
        which is very ironic, considering the fact that his family were once immigrants, and so
        were millions of his supporters.
    </p>

    <h2>Commander-impeach</h2>

    <p>
        Things took a sharp turn in 2020, when he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden,
        the Democratic nominee. However, he refused to accept the election results and tried
        to overthrow the government via the January 6th Capitol Riot. He failed and many got
        arrested. He also got impeached as a result. 
    </p>

    <p>
        From 2020 to 2024, he faced a lot of legal issues, or four felony cases to be exact.
        The first case — known as the "New York Hush Money Trial" — involves Trump
        <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-robert-costello-b1beb56a666c398ae5393ede16c326da">
            having an affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels 
        </a>
        before paying her $130,000 to make her stay quiet so he doesn't suffer from
        those consequences in the 2016 election. However, Trump allegedly faked the payment by stating
        that it is for "legal fees". 
    </p>

    <p>

        Trump's second criminal charge is about if Trump had
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump/index.html">
            mishandled classified documents.
        </a>
        After Trump left office, he took classified documents from the White House
        to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This is illegal under the Espionage Act, because
        he unlawfully retained the documents —which includes important national defense
        information —when he no longer had the authority to access them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Trump's third criminal trial includes his efforts to
        <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/trump-charged-in-federal-election-probe-his-third-criminal-indictment" target="_blank">invalidate the 2020 Presidential Election.
        </a>
         After the election, Trump tried to overturn the results by
        spreading lies about the election and attempted to use the Capitol attack as an excuse to
        postpone Biden's inauguration. Trump was charged with the conspiracy to defraud the US,
        conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and the conspiracy against the rights of the US citizens.

    </p>

    
    <p>

        In addition to all of the above mentioned cases, Trump is also accused of overturning the
        election results in the state of Georgia, where he was narrowly defeated by Biden.
    </p>

    <h2>Trump's 2024 Victory</h2>
    <p>
        If you think a convicted felon who tried to overthrow the government is ineligible to
        run for president, you unfortunately would be wrong,
        because Trump ran again in the 2024 election and
        won. Making him the first convicted felon to be elected as the President of the United
        States.
    </p>

    <p>
        And now, we are able to peek at what madness will he bring to the United States. To begin,
        He appointed Elon Musk—a billionaire, his patreon and friend, Robert F. Kennedy—an anti-vaccine
        conspiracy theorist, in his cabinet. Many expert predicted that he will restrict reproductive
        rights, he had publicly announced that he will launch a deportation for Mexican immigrants,
        and he recently declared that
        <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-promises-25-tariff-products-mexico-canada-2024-11-25/" target="_blank">
            he will raise tariffs for countries like Mexico, Canada and China</a>.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        Responding to the title of this blog post—what is my opinion on Donald Trump? Well, I
        disapprove of his immigration policies, because he have essentially changed the core
        values of America—a country with 97% of its people being immigrants. I also disapprove
        his opinion on abortion—he is anti-abortion. There is nothing pro-life about letting
        women suffer. Finally, I disapprove of him as a person, a person who was charged with
        4 felony cases but still believes that he should be above the law, which, he probably
        is, given the fact that 
        <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/barbara-mcquade-donald-trumps-civil-cases-arent-going-anywhere-1983345" target="_blank">
            charges against him are not going anywhere</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am going to wrap up this blog post here. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to expect
        from a country that has a convicted felon as president for the next 4 years.
